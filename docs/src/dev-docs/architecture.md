# Architecture

## Spider Architecture

`Spider` consists of several components that work together to provide a scalable, low-latency and
fault-tolerant distributed task execution system.

### Storage

`Spdier` relies on a fault-tolerant and ACID storage, e.g. MariaDB, to persist all the states of the
system.
The storage stores the following information:
* Tasks metadata, including:
  * Task ID
  * Task inputs/outputs type and values
  * Task status
* Job metadata, including
  * Job ID
  * Task graph
  * Job status
* Data objects, including:
  * Data object ID
  * Data object type
  * Data object value
  * References from tasks and clients
* Client/Scheduler/Worker metadata, including:
  * Client ID
  * Scheduler ID
  * Worker ID
  * Heartbeat timestamps

### Scheduler

Scheduler is responsible for:
* Allocating tasks to idle workers on their request
* Failure detection and recovery
* Garbage collection
* Straggler detection and task replication
For now `Spider` only supports a single scheduler, and we plan to support multiple schedulers if it
becomes the bottleneck of the system.

### Worker

A worker executes tasks allocated by the scheduler. It runs the following steps in loop:

1. Request a task from the scheduler
2. Fetch task inputs from the storage
3. Spawn a process to execute the task
4. Store task outputs in the storage and update task and job states
Each worker only executes one task at a time.

### Client

Client communicates only with the storage to submit jobs and query job status and fetch job
results.

## Data Abstraction

`Spider` provides a simple data abstraction for task inputs and outputs, which encapsulates the
* locality of the data, i.e. the addresses of the data
* checkpointed or not, i.e. whether the data is persisted
This abstraction allows `Spider` to support:
* locality-aware task scheduling
* fine-grained failure recovery
* garbage collection in background

## Fault Tolerance

`Spider` is designed to be fault-tolerant. The system can recover from failures of a scheduler or a
worker.

Schedulers, workers and clients send periodic heartbeats to the storage to indicate their liveness.
If a scheduler fails, the host can restart a new scheduler instance and fetch the latest state from
the storage.
If a worker fails while executing a task, the scheduler will detect the failure and perform
recovery of the job.
* Identify all the failed tasks within the job
* Compute the minimum subgraph that contains the fail tasks where all inputs to the subgraph are
  available
* Invalidate all the tasks in the subgraph, set the tasks on the input boundary as ready and the
  rest as waiting
